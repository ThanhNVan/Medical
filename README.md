# Medical Management Project

# Description:
As a healthcare facility, Khai Nguyen Polyclinic strives to offer high-quality medical services to its patients. 
The clinic has experienced significant growth over the years, adding more medical services and staff members.
However, this growth also poses some operational difficulties, especially in managing the pharmacy and human resources.

# Proposed Solution:
Our project aims to create a custom-made database software that will handle the Pharmacy and Human Resource Management System 
for Khai Nguyen Polyclinic. This software will help the clinic to modernize its pharmacy and HR operations, and ensure efficiency 
and quality in these areas. We are excited to work closely with Khai Nguyen Polyclinic to develop a solution that suits its 
specific needs and goals. This software will enable the clinic to maintain its high standards of medical care for its patients, 
while improving its internal processes.
